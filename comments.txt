Processor Architecture: 
1. Address Bus: Determines how much memory the processor can access. It’s unidirectional(from processor to memory/storage) and fixed in width by the hardware design.
2. Data Bus: Determines how much data the processor can transfer/process at once. It’s bidirectional (from processor to memory and the other way around) and also fixed by hardware.

How processor access data:
1. Sends the data address-generated by the processor itself-using the "Address Bus" to the "Memory Controller" ( an integrated component in modern processor but historically a separate component in the motherboard)
2. The "Memory Controller" locates the data then uses the "Data Bus" to read from or write to it
